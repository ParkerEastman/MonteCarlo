# MonteCarlo
Creates an array of random points.  Calculates "distance from origin" to determine probability of falling in scope of a theoretical quadrant of a circle.  Derived ratio is then used to calculate an estimate of Pi


##HW Answers
1. The calculated ratio is only for a single qudrant.  For a full circle, the ratio must be multiplied by 4 to estimate Pi.
2. The greater the int passed, in general, the more approximate the Pi estimation.
3. No, the random object is instantiated at runtime.  Each time the program is run, 
4. 100000000, deviation is 7.5 x 10^(-5)
5. Signals processing and Bayesian inference.  Developing an estimation of noise/interference.
